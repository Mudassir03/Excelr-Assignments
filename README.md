## Overview

This repository contains various data science assignments completed as part of the Data Science course at ExcelR Academy. These assignments cover a range of topics including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, and more. Each assignment demonstrates different concepts and techniques learned throughout the course, using Python as the primary programming language.

## Assignment Topics

The assignments in this repository include, but are not limited to:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Statistical Analysis
- Supervised Learning (e.g., Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (e.g., Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model Evaluation and Optimization
- Time Series Analysis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Deep Learning Basics

## Python Libraries Used

These assignments utilize various Python libraries, including:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling.
- **TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch** (if applicable): For deep learning models.
- **NLTK/Spacy** (if applicable): For Natural Language Processing.





Each assignment folder contains:

- **Jupyter Notebooks** or **Python scripts**
- **Datasets** (if applicable)
- **Results/Outputs** (if applicable)


## Results

The assignments include various outputs, such as visualizations, model performance metrics, and statistical analysis results. These outputs are showcased within the notebooks or scripts.
